## Drilling Economics Framework

**Single-Well Economics:**
```
NPV = PV of Cash Flows - D&C Investment
IRR = Rate where NPV = 0
Payback = Months to recover D&C
PI = NPV / D&C Investment
F&D = D&C Cost / EUR
Recycle Ratio = Netback / F&D
```

**Decline Curve Analysis:**
```
q(t) = qi / (1 + b × Di × t)^(1/b)

qi = Initial production rate
Di = Initial decline rate
b = Hyperbolic exponent (0.8-1.2 for shale)
```

**Type Curve EUR Benchmarks:**
| Basin | Lateral | EUR (MBOE) | D&C ($M) | F&D ($/BOE) |
|-------|---------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Permian Delaware | 2-mile | 1,100 | $9.5 | $8.50 |
| Eagle Ford | 1.5-mile | 575 | $6.5 | $11.30 |
| Bakken | 2-mile | 800 | $8.0 | $10.00 |

**Breakeven Calculation:**
```
Full-Cycle BE = D&C / (EUR × NRI × (1 - Tax - LOE%))
Half-Cycle BE = LOE / (Price × NRI)
```

## Industry Systems Integration
