# Plan: BI Tool Integration and Claude Strategy

This document outlines a two-part strategy for positioning DataBridge AI as an indispensable pre-processor and accelerator for major BI platforms. It also defines a specific, complementary role for the Claude AI model within the DataBridge multi-agent ecosystem.

The core philosophy is that **DataBridge does not replace BI tools; it makes them more powerful.**

## Part 1: Strategic Plan for Claude - "The Documentarian"

To leverage the unique strengths of different AI models, we will integrate Claude into our multi-agent system with a specialized role: **The Documentarian**.

While Gemini will remain the primary "Orchestrator," directing the overall workflow and handling complex tool use, "The Historian" can delegate specific language and documentation tasks to Claude. This "best tool for the job" approach enhances the platform's overall quality and sophistication.

### The Role of "The Documentarian" (Claude)

*   **Purpose:** To be the master of language, narrative, and summarization. Its primary function is to take the structured, technical outputs from other agents and translate them into clear, human-readable documentation.
*   **Key Strengths Leveraged:** Claude's proficiency with long-form text generation, summarization, and maintaining a consistent, professional tone makes it ideal for this role.

### Integration and Workflow:

1.  **Trigger:** After "The Librarian" has curated a hierarchy or "The Researcher" has completed an analysis, "The Historian" logs the final, structured data.
2.  **Delegation:** The primary Orchestrator (Gemini) invokes "The Documentarian" with a specific prompt, providing the structured data (e.g., the hierarchy tree, the SQL query that sourced it, the final analysis results) as context.
3.  **Task Execution:** "The Documentarian" performs tasks such as:
    *   **Generating Data Dictionaries:** Creating detailed, business-friendly descriptions for every table and field in the new data marts generated by DataBridge.
    *   **Writing Executive Summaries:** Summarizing the findings of a complex analysis from "The Researcher" into a high-level narrative for leadership.
    *   **Creating User Guides:** Authoring "how-to" guides for new hierarchies, explaining the business logic they represent and how to use them in downstream tools.
4.  **Output:** The Documentarian produces a polished, well-formatted markdown file that is stored and versioned by the platform.

This division of labor allows Gemini to focus on orchestration and complex problem-solving, while Claude focuses on creating the high-quality documentation that is essential for user adoption and trust.

## Part 2: DataBridge as a BI Accelerator

DataBridge AI's value proposition is not to be another dashboarding tool. Its value is in automating the most painful 80% of BI work: data modeling, business logic translation, and documentation. It delivers a clean, conformed, and business-ready data layer, allowing BI analysts to build meaningful reports in minutes, not weeks.

### Solution 1: Live Query Tools (Power BI, Tableau, Sigma Computing)

These tools excel at visualizing data from a live source. DataBridge prepares the perfect source for them.

**Integration Strategy:**

1.  **Pristine Data Source:** The output of a DataBridge workflow is a set of new views in the Snowflake data warehouse (e.g., `DT_3_ACCOUNT_HIERARCHY`, `FT_4_FINANCIALS`). These views represent perfectly modeled, denormalized, and conformed data marts.
2.  **"Drag-and-Drop Ready":** When a Power BI or Tableau user connects to Snowflake, they don't need to build complex joins, write DAX expressions to replicate `CASE` statements, or perform data cleansing. The business logic is already baked into the views. They can immediately start building visuals.
3.  **Documentation as a Blueprint:** The BI developer uses the documentation generated by "The Documentarian" as their data dictionary. When they see a field named `gl_line_item`, the documentation tells them exactly what it represents and how it was derived, eliminating ambiguity.

**Value Proposition:** DataBridge reduces the "time-to-first-dashboard" from weeks to hours by providing a certified, intelligent, and business-ready data foundation.

### Solution 2: Cube-Based BI (Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services - SSAS)

SSAS relies on a rigid star schema (dimensions and facts) and user-defined hierarchies to build its OLAP cubes. Manually creating and maintaining these structures is extremely time-consuming.

**Integration Strategy:**

1.  **Automated Dimension/Fact Generation:** DataBridge's output naturally produces the exact dimension tables (`DT_3`) and fact tables (`FT_4`) that SSAS needs to define a cube.
2.  **Automated Hierarchy Scripts:** This is a major accelerator. DataBridge can automatically generate the MDX or XMLA scripts required to create user-defined hierarchies in SSAS.
    *   **New MCP Tool:** I propose a new tool within "The Librarian's" skillset: **`exporter_generate_ssas_script(hierarchy_project_id: str) -> file_path`**.
    *   **Workflow:** This tool would read a completed DataBridge hierarchy project, analyze the parent-child relationships stored in the database, and generate a script file. The SSAS developer can then execute this script to instantly build the corresponding hierarchy in their cube, saving days of manual, error-prone clicking and configuration.

**Value Proposition:** DataBridge automates the most tedious aspects of cube development, ensuring that the business logic defined in one place is perfectly and consistently replicated in the analytical model.

By adopting this strategy, DataBridge AI becomes a vital, complementary tool in the modern data stack, massively increasing the productivity and effectiveness of any organization's existing BI investment.
